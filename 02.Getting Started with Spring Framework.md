## 3- What is the different between Java Bean vs POJO vs Spring Bean

### Java Bean: Classes have 3 constraints:

* Have public default (no argument) constructors
* Allow access to their properties using getter and setter methods
* Implement java.io.Serializable

### POJO: Plain Old Java Object

* No constraints Any Java Object is a POJO!

### Spring Bean: Any Java object that is managed by Spring

* Spring uses IOC Container (Bean Factory or Application Context) to manage these objects
